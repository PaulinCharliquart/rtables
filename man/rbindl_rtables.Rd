\title{Stack a list of rtables}
\usage{
rbindl_rtables(x, gap = 0, check_headers = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a list of rtable objects}

\item{gap}{number of empty rows to add between tables}

\item{check_headers}{whether to check that headers of involved rtables are identical
this may lead to performance problems}
}
\description{
See \code{\link{rbind.rtable}} for details
The difference is that this function takes a list of rtables as an argument whereas
rbind.rtable takes a list of arguments (...), each corresponding to an rtable.
}
\details{
empty rtables and NULLs in list are filtered out at first.
To bind rtables, you must make sure that the list contains at least one rtable and the header
of the first rtable will be taken. (Note that every rtable must contain a header). We do not test
that all rtable headers are identical for performance reasons.
When the list has zero length, return an empty rtable
}
