\usage{
make_pagdf(tt, colwidths = NULL, visible_only = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tt}{TableTree (or related class). A TableTree object representing a populated table.}

\item{colwidths}{numeric vector. Column widths for use with vertical pagination. Currently ignored.}

\item{visible_only}{logical(1). Should only visible aspects of the table structure be reflected in this summary. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\description{
Make layout summary  data.frame for use during pagination
}
\details{
When \code{visible_only} is \code{TRUE}, the resulting data.frame will have exactly one row per visible row in the table. This is useful when reasoning about how a table will print, but does not reflect the full pathing space of the structure (though the paths which are given will all work as is).

When \code{visible_only} is \code{FALSE}, every structural element of the table (in row-space) will be reflected in the returned data.frame, meaning the full pathing-space will be represented but some rows in the layout summary will not represent printed rows in the table as it is displayed.
