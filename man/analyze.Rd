\title{Generate Rows Analyzing Variables Across Columns}
\usage{
analyze(
  lyt,
  var,
  lbl = var,
  afun = rtab_inner,
  fmt = NULL,
  defrowlab = "",
  newtoplev = FALSE,
  inclNAs = FALSE,
  extrargs = list(),
  lblkids = TRUE,
  indent_mod = 0L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lyt}{layout object pre-data used for tabulation}

\item{var}{string, variable name}

\item{lbl}{string, label, often variable label}

\item{afun}{function. Analysis function, must take \code{x} or \code{df} as its first parameter. Can optionally take other parameters which will be populated by the tabulation framework. See Details in \code{\link{analyze}}.}

\item{fmt}{format string for cells}

\item{defrowlab}{character vector. Default row labels for resulting analysis rows.}

\item{newtoplev}{boolean, Add this as a new top-level split  (defining a new subtable directly under root). Defaults to \code{FALSE}}

\item{inclNAs}{boolean. Should observations with NA in the \code{var} variable(s) be included when performing this analysis. Defaults to \code{FALSE}}

\item{extrargs}{list. Extra arguments to be passed to the tabulation function. Element position in thte list corresponds to the children of this split. Named elements in the child-specific lists are ignored if they do not match a formal argument of the ttabulation function.}

\item{lblkids}{logical. Should the children of this split have label rows. Defaults to \code{NA} which creates a label row only if the child has 0 content rows.}

\item{indent_mod}{numeric. Modifier for the default indent position for the structure created by this function(subtable, content table, or row) \emph{and all of that structure's children}. Defaults to 0, which corresponds to the unmodified default behavior.}
}
\description{
Adding /analyzed variables/ to our table layout defines the primary tabulation to be performed. We do this by adding
calls to \code{analyze} and/or \code{\link{analyze_colvars}} into our layout pipeline. As with
adding further splitting, the tabulation will occur at the current/next level of nesting by default.
}
\details{
the analysis function should take as its first parameter either \code{x} or \code{df}. Which of these the function accepts changes the behavior when tabulation is performed.
\itemize{
\item{If \code{afun}'s first parameter is x, it will receive the corresponding subset \emph{vector} of data from the relevant column (from \code{var} here) of the raw data being used to build the table.}
\item{If \code{afun}'s first parameter is \code{df}, it will receive the corresponding subset \emph{data.frame} (ie all columns) of the raw data being tabulated}
}

In addition to differentation on the first argument, the analysis function can optionally accept a number of other parameters which, \emph{if and only if} present in the formals will be passed to the function by the tabulation machinery. These are as follows:
\describe{
\item{.N_col}{column-wise N (column count) for the full column being tabulated within}
\item{.N_total}{ overall N (all observation count, defined as sum of column counts) for the tabulation}
\item{.baseline_data}{data.frame subset corresponding to the baseline column. Currently does not reflect row-splittin but this will change. Optional and only required/meaningful if a baseline column has been defined}
}
}
